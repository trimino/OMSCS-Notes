# Lesson 22

This lesson will focus on architecture of **distributed systems**. Distributed systems typically involve multiple computers and are heterogeneous in nature (includes multiple components).

## Middleware

**Middleware** consists of _glue_ code which supports distributed heterogeneous computation. This is similar in concept to architectural connectors.

## Context

Why is distributed systems architecture relevant?

- Growth of networked machines
- Specialization of hardware resources
- Increasingly powerful applications

## Needs

What is required to support distributed applications?

- Abstractions (REST), interfaces (APIs), and standards (HTTP)
- Notations (e.g., XML)
- Tools (Spring Boot) which include design and code generation

## Exercise Application

In this lesson we will be examining distributed systems through an example application which is web-based and polls user opinion on a variety of questions. The application is able to record choices, display how others voted but keeping users anonymous.

## Characteristic Issues

We will also be examining the following issues:

1. **Network communication**:
   - Error handling/reliable delivery
   - Synchronous and asynchronous errors
   - Data representation and transport:
     - This could include machine differences, organization of constituent pieces, and self definition
   - Transactions:
     - Includes **ACID (Atomic, Consistency-preserving, Isolated, and Durable)**
     - Reliable database access with multiple readers and writers
     - Conditionally updating a record
     - Reliable transactions satisfy ACID properties
2. **Coordination**:
   - Synchronization
   - Control
   - Robustness
   - Availability
   - Persistence
3. **Reliability**:
   - Components of distributed systems sometimes fail
   - Failure to deliver or multiple delivers
   - Classic reliability/performance tradeoff
4. **Scalability**:
   - What has to be done to the system to deal with growth in users or load
   - To what extent will adding new machines change system architecture or components?
   - Transparency (e.g., access, location, migration, and replication transparency)
5. **Heterogeneity**:
   - Hardware
   - Operating systems
   - Programming languages
   - Standards, protocols, APIs
   - Access mechanisms
   - Web browsers
   - Devices

## Implications Of Heterogeneity

Some implications of heterogeneity include:

- Standard APIs (backward and forward compatibility)
- Normative architectures (model-driven architectures or MDA)
- Vendor comprehensive solutions

## Other Non-functional Issues

Other non-functional issues may include the following:

- Fault tolerance
- Flexibility
- Reuse/productivity
- Complexity management
- Quality of service

## Kinds Of Middleware

There are different kinds of middleware:

- **Transactional**: distributed transactions
  - Deals with reliability and ACID requirements
  - Two-phased commit
  - Distributed client/server with location transparency
- **Message-oriented**: message passing
  - Asynchronous message passing
  - Fault tolerant because of queues
  - Distributed event notification (push/subscribe)
  - Not very transparent (clients must implement coordination)
- **Procedural**: remote procedural call
  - RPC (remote procedural call)
  - Synchronous
- **Object/component**: remote object requests
  - Costs (e.g., object identity, inheritance)
  - Features (e.g., synchronous/asynchronous, marshalling, exception handling)

## Software Engineering Issues

There are also software engineering issues:

- **Requirements engineering**: elicitation of non-functional requirements
- **Software architecture**:
  - Derive architectures that will address non-functional requirements
  - Relationship of connections to middleware
- **Design issues**:
  - Network latency for distributed interactions
  - Activation, statefulness, persistence
  - Concurrency (e.g., synchronization, deadlock, avoidance, liveliness)

## Research Questions

Research questions in the area of distributed systems architecture might include:

- Naming (white pages) vs. trading (yellow pages)
- Use of reflection, meta-object protocols
- NoSQL
- Fat vs. thin clients (AJAX)
- Embedded systems/memory limitations

## Web Services

A **web service** is:

- W3C:

  > A software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network.

- Wiki:

  > An API or are APIs that can be accessed over a network, such as the internet and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services.

## Web Service Protocols

There are several web service protocols:

- **XML** - self-defining data descriptions
- **WSDL** - web services description language
- **UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)** - directory services (yellow pages)

## SOA

**SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)** is:

- Wiki:

  > A computer systems architectural style for creating and using business processes, packages as services throughout their lifecycle.

## SOA Services

SOA services can be described as:

- Service:
  - Self-contained, self-defined, modular application
  - Defined and self-documented use protocol
- Job responsibilities or business needs of the service user
- Comprised of a suite of sub-services (published, located, and dynamically invoked)

## Characteristics Of Services

There are several characteristics of services:

- **Flexibility**: obtained by factoring
- **Meaningful**: self-contained and user oriented
- **Stateless**: however, can make use of a database
- Transparent with respect to middleware

## Summary

To summarize, middleware is a collection of technologies for addressing non-functional constraints in heterogenous distributed applications. These technologies include APIs, protocols, tools, and design patterns.

## Section Quizzes

### Voting Application Quiz 1

_For the sample application, what data needs to be transmitted from the web browser to the server_?

Vote and question number

### Voting Application Quiz 2

_Is there a need for transactions in the application_?

It depends

### Voting Application Quiz 3

_For the sample voting application, should the clients or the server initiate interactions_?

Client sends vote to server

### Voting Application Quiz 4

_In a typical use case, how many different machines might involved in the processing of a single user's vote_?

### Voting Application Quiz 5

_What languages and protocols might have been involved in delivering the vote to the server_?

HTTP, SQL, AJAX

### LAMP Quiz

_LAMP is a mild form of normative architecture. Look it up and match each of the elements with how they might apply to a voting application_.

- L: Linux operating system
- A: Apache web server
- M: MySQL database engine
- P: PHP embedded SQL in HTML

### Middleware Quiz

_Which of the four forms of middleware would be the best match for the voting application_?

Transactional

### Service Oriented Quiz

_As currently defined, the voting application is not service oriented. What change would you make to have it correspond to the idea of services_?

We cloud make it such that each component (i.e., web, backend server, database) are each hosted in the cloud as separate services. Additionally, we could break each functionality such as voting or polling into separate services (e.g., separate AWS Lambdas).
