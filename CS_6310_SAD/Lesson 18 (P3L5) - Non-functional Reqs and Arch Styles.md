# Lesson 18

Software architecture prescribes the high-level structure of a system in terms of its components and how they interact. In this lesson we will look more into how software architecture should satisfy non-functional requirements.

## Qualities

Non-functional qualities includes **crosscutting** which is not provided by a single component but provided by many or all components. Crosscutting has a strong effect on a system's architecture.

## Quality Catalog

Below is a list of some common non-functional requirements:

- **Performance**: attribute of a computer system that characterizes the timeliness of the service delivered by the system
- **Maintainability**: extent to which enhancements can be readily added to a system (also called evolvability, flexibility, adaptability)
- **Reliability**: likelihood of failure in a given time period
- **Safety**: extent to which system protects against injury, loss of life, or property damage
- **Security**: extent to which system protects against unauthorized intrusion

## Architectural Styles

Below are some of the architectural styles we will examine:

- **Pipe and filter**: chain of processing elements called filters arranged so that the output of each element is communicated via a pipe to become the input of the next
- **Layered**: grouping of functionality into distinct layers that are stacked vertically on top of each other; communication between layers is explicit and loosely coupled
- **Blackboard**: a common knowledge base is iteratively updated by a diverse group of specialist knowledge sources
- **Object-oriented**: division of responsibilities into individual reusable and self-sufficient objects
- **Implicit invocation**: a component can broadcast events while other components in the system can register interest by associating a procedure with the event

## Pipe And Filter Qualities

Lets highlight some of the qualities of pipe and filter.

Performance:

- Pros: enhanced throughput because the filters can run in parallel
- Cons:
  - An individual filter may be slowed down if it is waiting for its supplier
  - May be a significant overhead due to context switches

Maintainability:

- Pros: enhances encapsulation
- Cons: increases coupling

Reliability:

- Pros: may be reduced due to the _weakest link_ filter

Safety:

- Pros: verification may be enhanced
- Cons: may be reduced by multiple dependencies

Security:

- Pros: simplicity increases opportunities for authentication, encryption and implementation of security levels

## Layering Qualities

Lets highlight some of the qualities of layering.

Performance:

- Cons:
  - May be reduced
  - Increased context swapping

Maintainability:

- Pros:
  - May be increased
  - May be even possible to replace an entire layer

Reliability:

- Pros: higher layers may have the oversight to provide redundancy
- Cons: reliability is reduced

Safety:

- Pros: may be easy to insert safety-monitoring layers

Security:

- Pros: security is enhanced

## Blackboard Qualities

Lets highlight some of the qualities of blackboard.

Performance:

- Cons:
  - lack of well-defined control flows may lead to redundant, administrative behavior

Maintainability:

- Pros: enhances flexibility
- Cons: changes to a common control paradigm or the repository's data format may have pervasive effects

Reliability:

- Pros: independence of the components can increase system resilience
- Cons: may be difficult to identify the cause of problems

Safety:

- Cons: can promote spreading of bad data

Security:

- Pros: access control is enhanced
- Cons: reduce confidence in overall system security

## Object-oriented Qualities

Lets highlight some of the qualities of object-oriented.

Performance:

- Cons:
  - Many small objects lead to multiple context switches
  - Can reduce responsiveness

Maintainability:

- Pros: significantly increased because of the independence of the components, both their encapsulated data and the hands-off, message-passing style of communications
- Cons: can increase system inter-component dependencies, thereby reducing maintainability

Reliability:

- Pros: encapsulation can reduce vulnerability to unintended interactions
- Cons: decentralized control reduces opportunity for oversight

Safety:

- Pros: improved intentionality and accountability

Security:

- Pros: encapsulation can reduce vulnerability
- Cons: increase system fragmentation

## Implicit Invocation Qualities

Lets highlight some of the qualities of implicit invocation.

Performance:

- Cons: extra communications can lead to reduced performance

Maintainability:

- Pros: may be increased (reuse due to independence of components)

Reliability:

- Pros: more easily able to deal with unexpected events
- Cons: overall understandability is reduced

Safety:

- Cons: increased interaction complexity may make it harder to ensure safety

Security:

- Pros: encapsulation can help mitigate fragmentation problems
- Cons: fragmentation can cause problems

## Summary

When designing a system be sure to take into account the positives and negatives of each implementation.
