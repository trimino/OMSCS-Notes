# Lesson 1

This lesson covers introductory topics for software architecture and design.

## Introduction

> A man is known by the design he keeps.

## Course

> Good design goes to heaven, bad design goes everywhere.

## Objectives

> Vision is the art of seeing the invisible.

There are several of objectives in this course:

1. Express the analysis and design of an application using the _UML_ (Unified Modeling Notation)
2. Specify function semantics of an application using _OCL_ (Object Constraint Language)
3. Specify and evaluate software architectures
4. Select and use appropriate architectural styles
5. Understand and apply object-oriented design techniques
6. Select and use appropriate software design patterns
7. Understand and participate in a design review

## Course Structure

> Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add but when there is no longer anything to take away.

## Readings

> A common mistake people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.

## Assignments

> Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.

## Projects: Design Studies

> Never be afraid to try something new. Remember, amateurs built the ark. Professionals built the Titanic.

## Policies

> The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.

## Grading

> Having employed dozens of designers, I've never once taken into account a candidate's academic qualification. I might take into account which design college, but I'm not swayed by the quality of degree... I just know that too many good designers achieved poor grades at design school and it is always worth looking beyond academic marks.

The following will be evaluated in this class:

- Projects
- Assignments
- Class participation
- Exam

## Class Participation

> People ignore design that ignores people.

The following will be evaluated in terms of class participation:

- Your teammates evaluations of you on the projects and assignments
- Your engagement in the quizzes that are part of the lessons
- Your non-gratuitous participation in the class forum

## Resources

> Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

## Conclusion

> A man who leaps off a cliff jumps to conclusion.
