# Lesson 9

We need to know what a program is supposed to do before we begin to write it. In this lesson we will focus on **specifications**. Specifications are informal text in a structured document.

## FOL

There are two notations for specifications:

- Mathematical logic
- OCL

**FOL (First Order Logic)** enables you to precisely express propositions, combine them, and quantify them.

## OCL

The other language we will use is **OCL (Object Constraint Language)** which is a part of UML. OCL provides a syntax for FOL that can be used to annotate UML diagrams.

## Sorting

A simple example will be to sort vectors of integers in ascending order (see lecture for full example). How to express this using specification notation?

## Process

The process of expressing the problem is to break the specification into three pieces:

1. Signature: what does the program look like?
2. Pre-condition: what must be true about the input?
3. Post-condition: what must be true about the output?

## Signature

The signature gives the name of the program, the names and types of the input arguments and the name and type of the results.

For `SORT` the signature is: `Vector<int> Y = SORT(Vector<int> X)`, where `X` and `Y` have explicit names (can be used in pre and post conditions). Additionally, `int` could be any data type.

## Summary

To summarize:

- Sometimes you need a way to precisely express exactly what functionality is required by a system
- A variety of formal languages and tools exists for writing such specifications
- The effort can save a lot of rework resulting from misunderstood requirements

## Section Quizzes

### SQRT Signature Quiz

_Give a signature for a function called SQRT that takes as input a real number and returns another real number whose value is the square root of the argument_.

`Real Y = SQRT(Real X)`

### SQRT Postcondition Quiz

_See if you can specify the postcondition SQRT given the signature_:

> `Real Y = SQRT(Real X)`

`Y * Y = X`

### ORDERED Precondition Quiz

_See if you can specify the precondition for ORDERED given the signature_:

> `Vector<int> Y = ORDERED(Vector<int> X)`

`True`

### ORDERED Spec And Pre Quiz

_Give the signature for the REORDERED function that determines whether an input Vector of integers is in descending order_.

`Bool Y = REORDERED(Vector<int> X)`

### PERMUTATION Signature Quiz

_Give the signature for PERMUTATION that takes two Vectors of integers and returns whether they are permutations of each other_.

`Bool Z = PERMUTATION(Vector<int> X, Vector<int> Y)`
