# Lesson 8

In this lesson we will go through an example where a librarian gives a list of requirements to a software engineer.

## Analyzing Requirements

The first step is to highlight all the nouns. Then we want to think about whether the nouns should be represented as a class or as an attribute.

## Refining Classes and Attributes

In the refining step, we want to think about whether or not the classes we have written down make sense to stand as its own class or can we refactor the class diagram?

## Adding Attributes

In this step we want to check back at the requirements to make sure that we capture any missing attributes.

## Identifying Operations

When we want to identify operations we want to check for verbs (action verbs that suggest what a class can do). Then we want to proceed to add those operations to the respective class.

## Adding Relationships

After adding operations, the next step is to add relationships. The type of relationships we will denote will depend on how different classes relate to another.

## Refining Relationships

After adding the initial set of relationships to our diagram, we should also look into refining our relationships to ensure that all relationships are properly represented.

## Refining the Class Diagram

In the next step, we should scan our class diagram to ensure that all classes, attributes, and operations are properly represented and if we can refactor further.

## Final Considerations

Final touch ups on the class diagram could include:

- Denoting attribute types
- Whether or not an attribute is computed
- Cardinality (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
